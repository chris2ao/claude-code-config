# Blog Style Guide - cryptoflexllc.com

**Author:** Chris Johnson
**Voice:** First-person, educational, technically detailed, honest about mistakes.

## Tone Options

### Educational and Friendly (default)
- Like explaining something cool to a colleague over coffee
- First-person ("I", "my", "we" when including the reader)
- Honest about mistakes (document what went wrong, not just what worked)
- Technically detailed (real commands, real code, real error messages)
- No fluff (every paragraph earns its place)
- Conversational but not sloppy (contractions fine, sentence fragments for effect fine, technical content precise)

### Witty and Accessible (for narrative/journey posts)
All of the above, PLUS:
- Humor throughout (puns, self-deprecating jokes, comedic timing)
- GIFs at emotional peaks (see GIF section below)
- `<Info>` explainer boxes for EVERY technical concept so non-technical readers follow along
- Relatable analogies (compare technical concepts to everyday things)
- Running jokes that callback throughout the post
- Should feel like a friend telling you about their wild week over coffee, not a tutorial

### Technical Reference
- Straightforward documentation style, minimal narrative, maximum code examples

## Structure Patterns

- Title in frontmatter matches the H1 heading
- **Opening paragraph** hooks with a relatable problem or compelling "here's what happened" setup
- **Use tables** for structured comparisons (tech stacks, before/after, feature lists)
- **Use code blocks** liberally for commands, config, code. Always with language tags
- **Bold for emphasis** on key terms and takeaways, not for shouting
- **Italics for inner thoughts** or asides ("wait... it can do that?")
- **"Why this matters"** explanations after technical sections
- **Lessons Learned** section near the end with numbered, practical takeaways
- **Series navigation** at the very bottom (auto-generated by orchestrator)

## Technical Explanation Pattern

Always follow: **Show the thing** -> **Explain what's happening** -> **Explain why it matters**

```
### The Feature Name

Here's the code/config/command:

(code block)

**What's happening:** Technical explanation of the mechanism.

**Why this matters:** Practical impact, what problem does this solve,
what would happen without it, how does this connect to the bigger picture.
```

## Things to AVOID

- Marketing language ("revolutionary", "game-changing", "unlock your potential")
- Vague statements without specifics ("it's really useful," say WHY and HOW)
- Excessive headers (don't create an H3 for a single paragraph)
- Apologizing or hedging ("I'm not an expert, but..." just explain the thing)
- Lists of links without context (every link should earn its place with explanation)
- Em dashes (NEVER, use commas, periods, colons, or parentheses instead)

## Example Opening Paragraphs (match the style, DO NOT copy)

From "Automating Session Wrap-Up":
> Every session with Claude Code ends the same way. You've written code, fixed bugs, learned something new, and now you need to document it all. [...] It takes 10-15 minutes. It's not hard. And that's exactly why it's dangerous.

From "My First 24 Hours":
> I started yesterday with a vague idea - "I should try AI-assisted coding" - and ended today with a production website, four GitHub repositories, a fully configured development environment, and more excitement about software than I've felt in years.

From "7 Days, 117 Commits":
> I was minding my own business at work when a colleague pulled up Claude Code and started building something. Not asking questions. Not Googling error messages. Building. A full, repeatable workflow with unit tests, deploying to production in about an hour. My exact reaction: "What the Helli!?!?!?"

## GIF/Meme Strategy

GIFs add personality to narrative posts. Optional for technical deep dives, encouraged for "Witty and accessible" tone.

### Placement
- Place at **emotional peaks**, not randomly decorating sections
- Target ~5-10 GIFs for long narrative posts (>15 min read), ~3-5 for standard
- Never two GIFs back-to-back without 2-3 sentences of narrative between them
- Every GIF needs descriptive `alt` text

### Giphy CDN Format
`https://media.giphy.com/media/{ID}/giphy.gif`

Search Giphy for the mood/reaction needed:

| Mood | Search Terms |
|------|-------------|
| Clueless excitement | "dog computer", "no idea what doing" |
| Mind blown | "mind blown", "shocked", "what" |
| Celebration | "celebration", "it works", "victory dance" |
| Denial/panic | "this is fine", "everything fine fire", "panic" |
| Frustration | "facepalm", "are you kidding me" |
| Relief | "finally", "victory dance", "relief" |
| Triumph | "mic drop", "finish line", "celebration" |

### MDX Format
```mdx
![A dog sitting at a computer pretending to type](https://media.giphy.com/media/EXAMPLE_ID/giphy.gif)
```

- Each GIF URL must be unique within the post (no duplicates)
- Verify GIF URLs resolve (not 404) before including
- GIFs render as standard `<img>` tags; CSP allows `img-src https:`

## `<Info>` Accessibility Pattern

For "Witty and accessible" tone, wrap EVERY technical concept in an `<Info>` callout the first time it appears.

**Example:**
```mdx
<Info title="What is a commit?">
Think of a commit like a save point in a video game. It captures a snapshot of all your code
at that moment, with a short note about what changed. If something breaks, you can go back
to any previous save point.
</Info>
```

**Concepts that always need an `<Info>` box (if targeting non-technical readers):**
Git, commits, branches, PRs, merge, API, endpoint, REST, HTTP methods, database, SQL, schema, migration, CI/CD, deployment, build, production, testing, coverage, unit test, integration test, WAF, firewall, rate limiting, cron job, webhook, environment variable, framework, library, dependency, package manager.

## Post Length Guidelines

| Post Type | Target Lines | Word Count | Reading Time |
|-----------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| Standard technical post | 300-500 | 2,000-3,500 | 8-15 min |
| Narrative/journey post | 400-650 | 3,500-6,000 | 15-25 min |
| Quick update/announcement | 150-250 | 1,000-1,500 | 4-7 min |

## Frontmatter Format

```yaml
---
title: "Full Post Title: With Subtitle if Needed"
date: "2026-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS"
description: "One or two sentences for post cards and SEO meta tags. Be specific."
tags: ["Claude Code", "Tag2", "Tag3"]
author: "Chris Johnson"
readingTime: "8 min read"
---
```

Rules:
- `date`: ISO format with time for deterministic sort order
- `description`: compelling but accurate, appears on blog listing page
- `tags`: include "Claude Code" if relevant, plus 2-4 topic-specific tags
- `readingTime`: estimate from word count (~200 words/minute)
- Title: specific, not generic. "Building X with Y" not "My Latest Project"
