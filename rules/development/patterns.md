# Common Patterns

## Skeleton Projects

When implementing new functionality:
1. Search for battle-tested skeleton projects
2. Evaluate options for security, extensibility, and relevance
3. Clone best match as foundation
4. Iterate within proven structure

## Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern

Encapsulate data access behind a consistent interface:
- Standard operations: findAll, findById, create, update, delete
- Business logic depends on the abstract interface, not storage
- Enables easy swapping of data sources and simplifies testing

### API Response Format

Use a consistent envelope for all API responses:
- Include a success/status indicator
- Include the data payload (nullable on error)
- Include an error message field (nullable on success)
- Include metadata for paginated responses (total, page, limit)
