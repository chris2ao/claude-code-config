# Agent Orchestration

> **Requires:** [everything-claude-code](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code) plugin. Without it, these agents are not available. Install via `/plugin marketplace add affaan-m/everything-claude-code`.

## Available Agents

| Agent | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| planner | Implementation planning | Complex features, refactoring |
| architect | System design | Architectural decisions |
| tdd-guide | Test-driven development | New features, bug fixes |
| code-reviewer | Code review | After writing code |
| security-reviewer | Security analysis | Before commits |
| build-error-resolver | Fix build errors | When build fails |
| e2e-runner | E2E testing | Critical user flows |
| refactor-cleaner | Dead code cleanup | Code maintenance |
| doc-updater | Documentation | Updating docs |

## Immediate Agent Usage

No user prompt needed:
1. Complex feature requests - Use **planner** agent
2. Code just written/modified - Use **code-reviewer** agent
3. Bug fix or new feature - Use **tdd-guide** agent
4. Architectural decision - Use **architect** agent

## Parallel Task Execution

ALWAYS use parallel Task execution for independent operations.
