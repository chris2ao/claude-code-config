# Testing Requirements

## Minimum Test Coverage: 80%

Test Types (ALL required):
1. **Unit Tests** - Individual functions, utilities, components
2. **Integration Tests** - API endpoints, database operations
3. **E2E Tests** - Critical user flows

## Test-Driven Development

MANDATORY workflow:
1. Write test first (RED) - it should FAIL
2. Write minimal implementation (GREEN) - it should PASS
3. Refactor (IMPROVE)
4. Verify coverage (80%+)
